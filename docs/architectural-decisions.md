# Architectural decisions

This is a documentation of some of the architectural decisions made in the team, and may be updated with time as the project grows.

## Decisions regarding the process

### How to take decisions

The team decides to take decisions together through communication in various means as long as a valid discussion can be held.

### Requirements

Frontend, backend, database.

## Decisions regarding tools

### Build tool

For frontend, the build tool that will be used is Vite.

For backend, we're developing in Python using FastAPI, and there's no need for a build tool.

### Version control

Version control is done using Git on GitHub.

### Deployment

One consideration for deployment is on Heroku. If possible we want to use a solution where the backend API is on the same domain but with a /api slug in the URL ready to use.

### IDE

Visual Studio Code will be used by both members in the team.

## Decisions regarding servers and frameworks

The backend server will be built with FastAPI, in Python.

## Decisions regarding code style

Since each of the two team members are responsible separately for frontend and backend, the code styles are mainly up to each individual.
